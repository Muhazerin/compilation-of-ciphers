# Vigenere Cipher
A Vigenere Cipher

## How it works
This program is different from the usual vigenere cipher shown in tutorials in the internet. This program supports the encryption/decryption of a larger group of characters.
This means not only does this program encrypts your Alphabet (uppercase and lowercase), it also encrypts your special characters such as !, "spaces", ".", etc.
With a larger plaintext pool, it is harder to bruteforce the cipher.
