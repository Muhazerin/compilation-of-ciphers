# Introduction

A variant of the substituition cipher created by Muhazerin.

It is not a single, but double substituition cipher.

## How it Works

Instead of the traditional single cipher used in the substituition cipher, this uses 2 ciphers.
With 2 ciphers, each character can alternate and use the 2 ciphers for encryption. This provides stronger encryption.
